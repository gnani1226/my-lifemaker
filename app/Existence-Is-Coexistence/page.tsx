                                <li>There is a certain kind of constitution which is permanent in nature (indestructible). It is also self-aware and conscious. It is free from physical forces, for example, doesn’t have weight. But it is (during its evolution stage) bound to the forces of expectations, thoughts, and desires. It can be called Life. It has a nucleus which is its mediator (also called the Soul). Surrounding the nucleus is the mind which has four layers. Detailed description about the five parts of Life can be found <a href="your-detailed-description-link-here">here</a>.</li>
                                <li>Life coexists with its body, the rest of Nature, and Space. It is always experiencing and interacting with the rest of coexistence, through a body (of gross or subtle nature). The soul is the ultimate witness or experiencer of all the experiences. It is the part that is the “I” in the Life. It is beyond the mind. The mind connects with the body. The body has senses to perceive the world. The mind gives the body instructions to act and perceives the world through the body, through the body’s senses.</li>

                                <li>Phase 2 - Evolution: The journey of maturity in conscious units (Life); i.e., from a lack of knowledge (Understanding, Truth) to knowledge.</li>
