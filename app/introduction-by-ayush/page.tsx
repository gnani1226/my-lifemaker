                    <p className='pl-2 lg:pl-4 text-sm md:text-md lg:text-xl font-light lg:leading-8'>I have been waiting for you to arrive at this page. My name is Ayush and for the time being, I am the sole author of the essays listed below, touching upon the essence of Life, Existence and undivided, happy and prosperous Human Society. I have been through (a still ongoing) cosmic and very human journey of reunion with the source and in my inquisitive explorations have found universally acceptable answers (resolution) to some important questions pertaining to human existence on Earth. My teachers and the works of many our ancestors and currently living human beings has been of invaluable help. Thanks to the collective effort by human species, we now have the full and final universal perspective of Self, Existence and human values and also the resolution to all human needs available to us. Here I share the same with you. Hope you enjoy the read, find it meaningful and send us feedback.</p>

Our intention is to keep the information shared here to be universally verifiable simple perspective of reality. It will take a collective effort for it to get completed. These is so much to talk about! These few articles are not even the tip of the iceberg. But they should be fine as a foundational start for the curious one. Also, the belief is that this literature of Lifemaker will forever be evolving, becoming better, thanks to our children and grand children who will continue to improve it even long after you and I are gone from the face of Earth.</p>
