All waves are intricately connected & weaved together as unique expressions & patterns in Existence composed of the fabric of energy. Each wave affects all the rest. They all exist together.

The substance that constitutes any Life is the same substance that constitutes every particle, wave or Life in Existence. The same substance that is manifesting as ‘others’ or ‘rest of Existence’ whether material or conscious, is manifesting as ‘me’. All is one infinite sea of which every part is inseparably connected to all other parts. Every atom and every Life affects the rest of infinite Existence and is in turn affected by the entirety of the rest of it. This is simply understandable by experience, observation and thought. Even science attests to this fact.</p>

Here we will focus on Earth and on our existence on Earth in human form right here, right now.</p>

The more it learns about its nature the better become its experiences. Life is free from physical forces of the universe like gravity. But till it is fully evolved it is bound by the force of desire (to experience). As Life experiences it understands how Existence is, how nature works, and it grows. It realises its true nature as infinite and eternal Existence having (having had and meant to forever have) infinite experiences, through uncountable forms. With manifestation of this knowledge in its mind and soul, Life finally attains eternal satisfaction and peace. As the fan of desires slowly comes to a halt, Life starts to shine forth as source of joy in its existence as co-existence. As Life matures it falls in love with all of Existence (its REAL SELF).</p>

Today most people are living by less than half of their mind. If we were living in a world where we lived with our souls as the master and the full mind as its loyal servant, we would all enjoy an incomparably better experience together.

In the inner experience of Life, proof of its maturity is the happiness, satisfaction, peace and bliss it experiences, in the love it feels for everyone, and the outer manifestation of maturity is how it lives selflessly and resolved with the world.</p>
