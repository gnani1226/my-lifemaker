Such family groups at village level will send one representative up to the village family level. The village groups will each send one representative to the district family level, so and so forth till the world family level where in the end around ~ 10 most wise, capable and trusted people will have boiled up from grassroots to top, all through consensus and trust based decision making.</p>

                    <p className='pl-2 lg:pl-4 text-sm md:text-md lg:text-xl font-light lg:leading-8'>If ever at any level, a group is not able to arrive at consensus on any issue, the represenatativeâ€™s decision shall be consensually, peacefully accepted by the members. A group will only be divided in wrong, and united in right. Under exceptional situations when there is indecisiveness, the representative will break the tie, after listening to all the members of their group. Since the representative is an intimate member of their group of around 10, and is chosen by the group with consensus, the group members will have put trust in the wisdom and good intention of the person chosen, from deep within. Additionally, the representative may seek advice from neighboring councils or higher councils or advisors chosen by their council, to feel confident about the choice to be made. This way everything that the society does will have agreement of every individual and group of the society from bottom up. This way, the society will also be able to handle conflicts and ensure justice (all round fulfillment vs. punishment) without going to the courts.</p>
