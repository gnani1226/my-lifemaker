Some fields are purely physical. Some allow active consciousness. Nature is disturbance in these fields. The disturbance can shift from one field to another thus taking another manifestation. For example, light energy can convert to electrochemical energy or heat. Manifest energy has infinite manifestations starting from atoms and subatomic particles of different kinds. All of these manifestations are co-dependent on each other. Every atom has an effect howsoever small, on every other atom in Existence and is affected by all of the rest of co-existence in turn. Same for every human. Every thing depends on everything else in co-existence.</p>

The moment Existence is seen as its parts the parts are seen to be co-dependent, complimentary and co-existing. All the fields co-exist, atoms co-exist, you co-exist, I co-exist. Speaking of Life, every Life co-exists with body. Body is co-existence of multiple layers ranging from gross physical to subtle energetic, lower mental, upper mental and causal bodies. Every two humans are co-existing together. There is co-existence between the seer and the seen too. Existence is energy is all-that-is. But when seen as constituent parts all of Existence is co-existence. Nature in Void is co-existence. Nature within itself is co-existence. Co-existence is the infinite and eternal play between fields of various kinds.</p>
