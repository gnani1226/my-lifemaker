                    In a blossoming family, everyone understands more and more clearly that they are together not only to live physically together and survive, but to mature as individuals on human journey. In any situation, the members strive to ensure that they act or respond with the right understanding (wisdom). They all understand that they need to feel all the right feelings mutually in their relationships; like acceptance, respect, trust, care, guidance, appreciation, gratitude, unconditional love.

                    They together strive for continuity of happiness, wellbeing and prosperity for the entire family. Instead of thinking primarily about one’s individual, every member of such a family aspires for everyone’s filfillment; together, within oneself, with each other and, with the (entire) rest of society and nature.

                    Such a family impartially loves everyone outside of their home as much as the ones who are coliving with them. This impartial love is the full blossoming of love. And such a family is fully blossomed when it feels this way for the whole world. Every member of such a family witnesses humane coexistence, in its fullest glory.
