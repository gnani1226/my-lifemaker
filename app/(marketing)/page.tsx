It will provide a fertile environment and culture to fulfill the most fundamental aspiration and purpose of every human on Earth; from family to family and generation to generation.

                    <p className='pl-2 lg:pl-4 text-sm md:text-md lg:text-xl font-light lg:leading-8'>Every human needs four essential things - understanding, relationship, health and physical facility. Now what is the priority of these? The univeral answer seems to be understanding &gt; relationship &gt; health &gt; physical facility. Knowing these four with their priority itself is an understanding.</p>

                    <h1 className='font-heading text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl tracking-wide leading-5 lg:leading-normal '>But how are we living today?</h1>

And uh, I don’t feel the need to understand much more. I am so busy with my work and have also finished my education!</p>
                    <p className='pl-2 lg:pl-4 text-sm md:text-md lg:text-xl font-light lg:leading-8'>If a human being doesn’t have understanding, it suffers whether or not realizing it. It stays discontent in relationships, develops poor health and has an unhelpful and unsatisfactory equation with physical facility, even if very rich. Indeed today we are all suffering because of our lack of understanding as individuals and society. It is clear that while we want to educate ourselves and our children, we have so far not even understood who we are as human, what are the needs of a human and what is the fundamental purpose of education for a human. Is education about just getting literacy and skills for getting a professional job? What is education? Hence as a result, today we have a society where there are many problems all around - in individual lives and as a collective.</p>
                    <p className='pl-2 lg:pl-4 text-sm md:text-md lg:text-xl font-light lg:leading-8'>Realization of universal knowledge and resolution, is the need, purpose, opportunity and challenge of every human life. With knowledge of the self, a human becomes true to itself, i.e. it becomes free of all mental corruption, conflict, tension, fear, stress, worry etc., which arise from assumptions, thoughts, attachments, expectations and desires stemming from an improper understanding. Knowledge, i.e. being the pure self as-I-am, is the only and stable source of happiness, peace, satisfaction and joy, that lasts. Knowledge is the doorway to real, everlasting freedom and self governance. Knowhow and talent, i.e. how to live, navigate, cocreate with the laws of Nature is useful for living as humans. Hence, to ensure holistic education within and in family/society is a need and responsibility of every human. From there the resolution flows contagiously to the rest.</p>
